      <h1>AC100 Gear & Local Resources</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">
        Most 100-mile gear lists are generic. Angeles Crest 100 runs through
        dusty, rocky singletrack, hot canyons, and a long stretch of night
        above Los Angeles. This page focuses on the few systems that matter
        most for this race — and where to dial them in if you’re training
        around the San Gabriels.
      </p>
      <p class="page__lede">
        Some links on this page may be affiliate links, which means I may earn
        a small commission if you buy through them at no extra cost to you. I’ll
        only recommend gear and services that make sense for AC100 terrain and
        logistics.

    <!-- 1. PRIORITIES OVER BRANDS -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>1. What matters most at AC100</h2>
      <p>Before specific models or brands, focus on these systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feet:</strong> shoes and socks that stay comfortable on rocky, dusty trail for 24–33 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Night kit:</strong> a reliable primary headlamp, a backup, and batteries you’ve actually tested.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat management:</strong> sun protection, ice carry, and clothing that works in hot canyons.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration & calories:</strong> a system you can refill quickly and eat from when tired.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop bag kit:</strong> small, repeatable setups you can manage even when your brain is fried.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. FEET & SHOES -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>2. Feet & shoes</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll be on your feet for a very long time over mixed terrain:
        smoother singletrack, rocky sections, some fire road, and dusty descents.
        Your choice of shoes and socks needs to survive all of that.
      </p>

      <div class="gear-grid">
        <div class="gear-card">
          <h3>Daily training shoes</h3>
          <p>
            Use these for most of your build-up miles. Something durable,
            comfortable, and forgiving enough for long back-to-back days.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Comfort over “fast” feel.</li>
            <li>Enough cushion for long descents on tired legs.</li>
            <li>Grip that works on loose gravel and hardpack.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gear-note">
            Insert 1–2 affiliate links here once you’ve tested and picked
            favorites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="gear-card">
          <h3>Race pair (or rotation)</h3>
          <p>
            Many runners use the same model they trained in, sometimes with a
            fresh pair swapped at a major aid station.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Something you’ve worn for at least a few long runs.</li>
            <li>No last-minute “new shoe day” surprises.</li>
            <li>Room in the toe box for swelling.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gear-note">
            Affiliate link block: “My go-to race shoes for AC100-style courses”.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="gear-card">
          <h3>Socks & foot care</h3>
          <p>
            Blisters and maceration ruin more races than lack of fitness. Build
            a simple, repeatable foot-care routine.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Two or three sock models that work for you.</li>
            <li>Anti-friction lube, tape, and small scissors.</li>
            <li>Spare socks in key drop bags.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gear-note">
            Add 1–2 sock recs and a basic blister kit link here.

    </section>

    <!-- 3. NIGHT KIT -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>3. Night kit</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll likely spend many hours in the dark, especially if you’re
        closer to the back of the pack. Reliable light is non-negotiable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary headlamp with enough lumens and battery life for your pace.</li>
        <li>Backup headlamp or handheld light (not just spare batteries).</li>
        <li>Fresh batteries or charged power banks in at least one drop bag.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        This is a high-value affiliate section: link to 1–3 headlamps you trust
        for 100-mile nights, plus spare battery options.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. HEAT & SUN -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>4. Heat & sun management</h2>
      <p>
        AC100 can be hot and exposed in certain canyons and ridges. Plan as if
        you’ll see more heat than you want to, even in a “mild” year.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Light-colored hat with good coverage.</li>
        <li>Ice bandana or neck wrap for hot sections.</li>
        <li>Light arm sleeves and breathable top.</li>
        <li>High-SPF sunscreen that doesn’t sting your eyes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        Add specific hat, sleeves, and cooling gear links here once you’ve
        tested them in SoCal heat.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. HYDRATION & CALORIES -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>5. Hydration & calories</h2>
      <p>
        Aid stations are generous, but you still need a system you can manage
        when tired and a bit cooked. Think in simple rules, not complex math.
      </p>

      <div class="gear-grid">
        <div class="gear-card">
          <h3>Hydration systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Trail vest with room for bottles, food, and a light shell.</li>
            <li>Two or more soft flasks or handheld bottles.</li>
            <li>Optional: bladder for longer dry stretches if you prefer it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gear-note">
            Link to 1–2 vests and the bottle/flask combo you like for AC100.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="gear-card">
          <h3>Calories that work late</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>At least 2–3 types of calories you know your stomach tolerates.</li>
            <li>Mix of drinks, gels, and “real food” so you’re not stuck with one thing.</li>
            <li>Backup emergency calories in each drop bag.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gear-note">
            This is a good place for drink mix, gel, and chews links if you
            have favorites.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. DROP BAG KIT -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>6. Drop bag basics</h2>
      <p>
        Drop bags are your entire support system if you’re running Solo, and a
        useful backup even if you have crew. Keep the system simple and
        repeatable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Durable bags that are easy to spot and open in the dark.</li>
        <li>Big, clear labels with your name, bib, and aid station.</li>
        <li>Standard “mini-kit” repeated in multiple bags (socks, lube, calories, small light).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        Add links for simple durable bags, labels, and any small organizers you
        actually like here.
      </p>

    <!-- 7. LOCAL RUNNING STORES -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>7. Local running shops near the San Gabriels</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re in Southern California, you don’t have to guess online. These
        shops can help you test shoes, packs, and lights in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll be building out short profiles of the most AC100-relevant shops
        here (hours, strengths, nearby trails, and whether they host group runs
        in the San Gabriels).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shop A – short description and what they’re best at.</li>
        <li>Shop B – short description and what they’re best at.</li>
        <li>Shop C – short description and what they’re best at.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        Long term: this is where you can feature local partners or sponsors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. LODGING & FOOD -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>8. Lodging & food: Wrightwood and Pasadena/Altadena</h2>
      <p>
        Where you sleep and eat before and after the race matters, especially
        if you’re traveling with family or crew.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wrightwood base:</strong> small cabins, motels, and rentals close to the start.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasadena/Altadena base:</strong> hotels and rentals near the finish and freeways.</li>
        <li><strong>Food:</strong> runner-friendly options for pre-race and post-race meals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        When you’re ready, you can add hotel/booking affiliate links for “where
        to stay race week” here.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 9. RECOVERY & SUPPORT -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>9. Recovery & support in the SGV / LA area</h2>
      <p>
        If you live in or near the San Gabriel Valley, having a small recovery
        crew can keep you training consistently.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sports PT clinics that understand trail and ultra runners.</li>
        <li>Massage therapists experienced with heavy leg volume.</li>
        <li>Chiro and other specialists you actually trust.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="gear-note">
        This is another future local partner section. Start neutral; feature
        sponsors only after you’ve built trust.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 10. CHECKLIST + NEXT STEPS -->
    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>10. Quick checklist before race week</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You’ve done at least one long training run with your full race vest and lights.</li>
        <li>Your feet setup (shoes, socks, lube) has been tested on long descents.</li>
        <li>You’ve practiced your hydration and calorie system in heat and at night.</li>
        <li>All drop bags are packed, labeled, and photographed for reference.</li>
        <li>Lodging and transport to start/finish are confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Later, this checklist can become a printable PDF or part of a low-cost
        AC100 gear packet. For now, use it as your pre-race sanity check.
