      <h2>AC100 qualifying rules (plain English)</h2>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Baseline:</strong> Finish an <strong>official</strong> race that is <strong>50 miles or longer</strong> with <strong>published results</strong> inside the current qualifying window. Virtual races do not count.</p>
      </div>

      <p>AC100 requirements change year to year. Use this page to pick a race, then confirm the current rules and submission deadlines on the official AC100 registration page before you commit.</p>

      <div class="warn">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> A 50K is shorter than 50 miles. Do not assume a 50K qualifies unless AC100 explicitly states an exception for a specific entry pathway.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What “official” usually means</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Results are publicly posted (UltraSignup or an official results page).</li>
        <li>The event is a real race (not virtual, not solo time trial).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <h3>What else you will likely need</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Trail work hours by the AC100 deadline.</li>
        <li>Proof of qualifier (link to results page).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="fastest" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>Fastest path: Sterling Silver Ticket races (guaranteed entry pathway)</h2>
      <p>If you want a higher-upside route than the lottery, target races that award AC100 “Sterling Silver Tickets.” Most are 50 milers. A small number of top finishers earn guaranteed entry (still responsible for entry fee and trail work).</p>

      <div class="grid" style="margin-top:12px;">

    <section id="socal" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>Best SoCal 50-milers (short drive from Los Angeles)</h2>
      <p>These are the most practical qualifiers for LA runners because travel is simple. They also build the exact skills AC100 punishes: long climbs, heat management, and durable legs for descending.</p>

      <h3>Top picks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Griffith Park 50 Mile (Los Angeles)</strong>: logistically easy, good “first 50” option, and you can simulate AC100 heat if the day warms up.</li>
        <li><strong>Ray Miller 50 Miler (Malibu)</strong>: runnable climbs and steady effort. Great as a controlled “time on feet” test.</li>
        <li><strong>Sean O’Brien 50 Miler (Calabasas)</strong>: classic SoCal trail running, usually competitive, solid prep for sustained pacing.</li>
        <li><strong>Leona Divide 50 Mile (Lake Hughes / Santa Clarita)</strong>: one of the best AC100-specific builders: climbs, exposure, and honest fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Malibu Canyon 50 Mile (Malibu)</strong>: long, steady, and a good way to practice nutrition pacing without massive travel.</li>
        <li><strong>PCT 50 (Cleveland National Forest)</strong>: higher elevation profile than many SoCal races, real trail, and a legitimate “mountain legs” day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Wildcard (not a 50-miler, but relevant if you chase tickets)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pacifico Ultra 50K (Angeles National Forest)</strong>: this is not 50 miles, but it appears in the ticket series as a special exception. Do not confuse this with the standard 50-mile qualifier rule.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="westcoast" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>Best West Coast 50-milers (smart travel)</h2>
      <p>If SoCal races fill up, these are strong backups with reliable organization and good terrain. They also make you tougher in ways that carry into the San Gabriels.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>American River 50 Mile (Folsom to Auburn)</strong>: fast runnable miles, great benchmark for pacing and fueling discipline.</li>
        <li><strong>Monterey Ultra 50 Miler (Monterey)</strong>: variety of trail surfaces, steady work, and a full-day effort without extreme exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Outlands 50 Mile (Pilot Hill)</strong>: rugged singletrack around Folsom Lake area, good for durability.</li>
        <li><strong>Rim Rock 50 Mile (Napa)</strong>: solid climbing and late-race leg fatigue practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool Moon 50 Miler (Cool)</strong>: a legit summer suffer-fest; treat it as heat and grit training.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pick" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>How to choose the right qualifier</h2>

      <h3>If this is your first 50-miler</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick the easiest logistics first (Griffith Park, Ray Miller).</li>
        <li>Prioritize finishing over racing. AC100 cares that you finished an official 50 miles.</li>
        <li>Choose a course that lets you keep moving even when your stomach gets weird.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If you want the best AC100-specific fitness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Leona Divide or PCT 50 are closer to “real mountain work” than most LA-area options.</li>
        <li>Use the race to practice: early restraint, steady calories, and downhill control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If you want a shot at guaranteed entry</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Target ticket series races and show up fit. Ticket spots are for top finishers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="timeline" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>Timeline: when to run your 50-miler before AC100</h2>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Simple target:</strong> run your qualifier <strong>12 to 20 weeks</strong> before AC100. That gives you recovery time and a clean build into the race.</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>20-16 weeks out:</strong> best window if you want a full rebuild cycle after the 50.</li>
        <li><strong>16-12 weeks out:</strong> best window if you recover quickly and want sharper fitness closer to race day.</li>
        <li><strong>Under 10 weeks out:</strong> doable, but you risk carrying fatigue into your final build.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">If you are LA-based, you can add AC-specific training on local climbs (Mt Wilson, Baden-Powell, long descents) after the qualifier without flying anywhere.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="faq" class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Do I need my 50-miler before I enter the AC100 lottery?</h3>
      <p>Often no. Many years allow you to enter first and submit proof later, as long as you meet the deadline.</p>

      <h3>Does a 50K qualify?</h3>
      <p>Normally, AC100 is a 50-mile-or-longer qualifier. A 50K is shorter than 50 miles. Only treat a 50K as valid if AC100 explicitly publishes an exception for a specific pathway.</p>

      <h3>What counts as “published results”?</h3>
      <p>Typically a public results page (UltraSignup or an official race website results page).</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p class="muted"><strong>Tip:</strong> Build supporting pages for each race above (course notes, elevation, “who this is for,” logistics from LA, and a training mini-plan). This creates long-tail SEO that feeds into this hub page.</p>
