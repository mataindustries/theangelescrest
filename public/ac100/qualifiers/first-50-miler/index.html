      <h1>Your First 50-Miler (AC100 Qualifier Guide)</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">
        Before you can chase a buckle at Angeles Crest 100, you need to prove
        you can go long. AC100 requires a qualifying ultra (often a 50-mile or
        longer trail race — always check the official rules for the current
        list and distances).
      </p>
      <p class="page__lede">
        For most of us, that means training for a first 50-mile race. This
        guide is a simple roadmap: how to choose the right race, how long to
        train, and what actually matters in your build if AC100 is the big
        goal in the background.

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>1. Why start with a 50-miler?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s a realistic stretch goal if you’ve done marathons or 50ks.</li>
        <li>Many AC100-eligible races are 50 miles or 100k on similar terrain.</li>
        <li>You get to test gear, stomach, and mindset before a full 100.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You <strong>must</strong> confirm current AC100 qualifying standards on
        the official race website and pick a race from their accepted list.
        This page focuses on the training and mindset side so you’re ready when
        you toe that first 50-mile start line.

      <h2>2. Who this guide is for</h2>
      <p>This is written for runners who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have finished at least one marathon or 50k (trail or road).</li>
        <li>Can realistically train 4–6 days per week most weeks.</li>
        <li>Are willing to get on trails and hills regularly, even if they live in the city.</li>
        <li>See AC100 as a 1–3 year target, not a “right now” thing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>3. Timeline: from today to your first 50</h2>
      <p>Here’s a simple way to think about the next year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Months 0–3:</strong> Build a consistent base (3–5 runs per week, modest long run).</li>
        <li><strong>Months 3–6:</strong> Extend long runs and add more vert (hills, descents, trails).</li>
        <li><strong>Last 10–14 weeks before race:</strong> Focused 50-mile block with key long runs, back-to-backs, and a short taper.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you already have a solid base, you may be able to condense this into
        a 16–24 week focused build. Don’t rush just to check a qualifier box;
        you want to arrive at the start line prepared, not cooked.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Key training priorities</h2>
      <p>For a first 50, especially with AC100 in mind, focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> 4–6 runnable days most weeks beats occasional hero long runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Time on feet:</strong> Long runs that teach you how it feels to move for 4–8 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Climbs and descents:</strong> Practice hiking uphill strong and running downhill under control.</li>
        <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> A simple, repeatable plan for calories and fluids you’ve tested in training.</li>
        <li><strong>Night or early-morning sessions:</strong> At least one or two runs when you’re tired or in the dark.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>5. Sample week structures</h2>
      <p>These are <em>patterns</em>, not strict plans:</p>

      <h3>Base phase (months 0–3)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 easy runs (30–60 minutes).</li>
        <li>1 moderate run with some hills or strides.</li>
        <li>1 longer run building from 60 to 120 minutes.</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 cross-training or strength session.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Build phase (months 3–6)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 easy runs (40–60 minutes).</li>
        <li>1 hill session (short repeats or a steady climb/descent loop).</li>
        <li>1 long run (2–3+ hours) on trails.</li>
        <li>Optional: back-to-back day (shorter run the day after long run).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Focused 50-mile block (last 10–14 weeks)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 shorter quality or hill session (never all-out).</li>
        <li>1 medium-long run midweek (60–90 minutes).</li>
        <li>1 long run most weekends.</li>
        <li>Back-to-back long weekends on 2–4 key weeks.</li>
        <li>2 easier weeks sprinkled in to absorb the work.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>6. Choosing the right 50-mile race</h2>
      <p>When picking a qualifier, look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A course profile that teaches you something useful for AC100 (climbs, descents, heat).</li>
        <li>A cutoff you can realistically make with a steady, patient effort.</li>
        <li>Logistics that won’t destroy you (travel, altitude, extreme weather you’re not ready for).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When in doubt, a reasonably hilly trail 50-miler within driving
        distance is usually better than a “dream race” across the country.

      <h2>7. Gear for your first 50 (without overbuying)</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need a closet full of gear to finish a 50, but you do need a
        few things that actually work together. At minimum:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shoes and socks you’ve worn on several long runs.</li>
        <li>A vest or handheld setup that carries what you need comfortably.</li>
        <li>A headlamp if there’s any chance you’ll be out in the dark.</li>
        <li>Basic foot-care and chafing supplies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For deeper gear specifics (and affiliate links as I test things), see
        the <a href="/gear.html">AC100 gear & local resources guide</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>8. Race-week and race-day basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive with a simple, written plan for fueling and pacing.</li>
        <li>Pack drop bags (if allowed) with just enough backup gear and calories.</li>
        <li>Decide how you’ll handle low points before you hit them.</li>
        <li>Give yourself permission to hike strong and protect your quads on descents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember: the goal of your first 50 is to <strong>finish steady</strong>,
        not to squeeze out every minute. You’re building a base for AC100, not
        trying to prove everything in one day.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>9. After you finish: turning a 50 into AC100 momentum</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write down what worked, what broke, and what surprised you.</li>
        <li>Note any recurring issues (feet, stomach, pacing) to fix in the next training block.</li>
        <li>Schedule an easy recovery window, then a light “what’s next” chat with yourself.</li>
        <li>Re-check AC100’s qualifying list and timelines once your result is official.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A well-executed 50-miler gives you confidence and data. You’ll know
        what AC100 asks you to multiply, not just imagine it.

      <h2>10. Personal notes from the San Gabriels</h2>
      <p>
        I’m training for my own first 50-miler right now from Glendora, using
        the local climbs and heat to build toward AC100-style fitness. I’ll
        keep a short training log and “what I wish I knew earlier” notes here
        as I go, so you can see a real example instead of just theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, your best next steps are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read the <a href="/ac100-guide.html">AC100 Start Here guide</a>.</li>
        <li>Skim the <a href="/solo-playbook.html">Solo Division Playbook</a> if you’re leaning that way.</li>
        <li>Make a short list of 50-mile races that qualify for AC100 and fit your life.</li>
