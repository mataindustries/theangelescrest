      <p class="page__lede">Slow your pace early, carry more fluid than you think you need, and cool aggressively before symptoms pile up. If dizziness, confusion, chills, or nausea worsen, stop the run and get to shade and cooling immediately.</p>

      <h2>What should be on your checklist?</h2>
      <p>Use this checklist to cover the essentials before race day or your next key training run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the trail-specific forecast, not just city temperature.</li>
        <li>Start earlier and lower intensity on hot days.</li>
        <li>Bring extra fluid, sodium, and a cooling tool (ice bandana or water pour).</li>
        <li>Know your bail-out points before starting exposed sections.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>What steps should you follow?</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps in order so your plan stays simple and repeatable under AC100-style conditions.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Adjust your target pace to heat index and route exposure.</li>
        <li>Drink and fuel on schedule rather than waiting for thirst collapse.</li>
        <li>At first warning signs, reduce effort and cool in shade for several minutes.</li>
        <li>If symptoms do not improve quickly, end the run and recover safely.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is a training guide, not medical advice; if heat illness is suspected, prioritize medical care.</p>
