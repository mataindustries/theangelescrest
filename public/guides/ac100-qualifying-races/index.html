      <h1>What races qualify for AC100?</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">For AC100, you typically need an official 50-mile or longer race with posted results inside the current qualifying window. Because requirements can change year to year, always confirm the current accepted-race rules on the official AC100 site before registering.</p>

      <h2>What should be on your checklist?</h2>
      <p>Use this checklist to cover the essentials before race day or your next key training run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check this season's official AC100 qualifying distance and deadline.</li>
        <li>Pick a race with reliable timing and public results.</li>
        <li>Choose a course profile that helps AC100 prep: climbing, heat, and long descents.</li>
        <li>Save your results link immediately after you finish.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>What steps should you follow?</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps in order so your plan stays simple and repeatable under AC100-style conditions.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set your target AC100 year, then work backward to your qualifier timeline.</li>
        <li>Shortlist two or three qualifying races you can realistically travel to from SoCal.</li>
        <li>Build training around finishing steady, not forcing an aggressive pace.</li>
        <li>Submit proof early so any admin issue is fixable before deadlines.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Examples runners often consider in this region include events like Ray Miller, Sean O'Brien, Leona Divide, and other West Coast 50-milers, but only the current official AC100 list is authoritative.</p>
