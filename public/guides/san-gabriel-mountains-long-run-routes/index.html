      <h1>Which San Gabriel long run routes actually prepare you for AC100?</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">Routes that combine sustained climbing, long descending, and exposed heat are the most useful AC100 preparation. You do not need one exact route; you need repeatable long-run patterns that build durability under SoCal conditions.</p>

      <h2>Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose one climb-focused route and one descent-focused route.</li>
        <li>Use a loop or out-and-back where bailout points are clear.</li>
        <li>Test fueling and hydration exactly as planned for race day.</li>
        <li>Track heat, vert, and how your legs handle the final hour.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with a weekly long-run route you can repeat for 3-4 weeks.</li>
        <li>Add vertical gain in small jumps rather than random big spikes.</li>
        <li>Every few weeks, run back-to-back long days to mimic late-race fatigue.</li>
        <li>Rotate in hot canyon sessions and early-night finishes to simulate AC100 stress.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Prioritize route consistency and execution quality over chasing a new trail every weekend.</p>
