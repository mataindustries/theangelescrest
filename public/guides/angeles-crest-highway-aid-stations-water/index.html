      <h1>Where can I get water along Angeles Crest Highway on AC100 weekend?</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">For AC100 weekend, the safest plan is to carry and stage your own crew water instead of depending on random roadside taps. Aid stations support runners, but crew logistics should assume limited and changing public water access on Highway 2.</p>

      <h2>Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-fill large water jugs before entering long Highway 2 segments.</li>
        <li>Bring separate drinking water and ice water for runner cooling.</li>
        <li>Save backup refill locations in towns before and after mountain access.</li>
        <li>Carry extra bottles in case traffic or closures delay your schedule.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Map your crew route and mark the longest stretch with no reliable refill.</li>
        <li>Load enough water for that stretch plus one missed stop buffer.</li>
        <li>At each crew point, prioritize runner bottles first, then cooling needs.</li>
        <li>Refill at known open facilities whenever available instead of waiting for emergency levels.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Treat every roadside source as uncertain unless you verified it recently and have a backup.</p>
