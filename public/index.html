      <p>
        Angeles Crest 100 is a historic point-to-point mountain hundred through
        the San Gabriels. Big vert, hot canyons, tight cutoffs, and tricky
        logistics. This guide translates the official docs and scattered race
        reports into a clear path from “maybe” to finish line.

        AC100 isn’t just about mileage. It’s long climbs, punishing descents,
        heat in the canyons, and a long stretch of night in the San Gabriel
        Mountains. The more your training looks like race day, the better.

      <h2>5. Qualifying with your first 50-miler</h2>
      <p>
        AC100 requires a qualifying ultra from an approved list (distances and
        rules can change, so always check the official race website). For most
        runners, a trail 50-mile race is the most practical path: it’s long
        enough to prove you can go deep, but short enough to fit into normal
        life with smart training.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve put together a separate guide focused just on that step:
        choosing and training for a first 50-mile race with AC100 in mind.

      <p>
        Most 100-mile gear lists are generic. Angeles Crest has very specific
        demands: dusty singletrack, hot sun, rocky descents, and a long night
        above Los Angeles. Small gear mistakes become big problems at 2:00 a.m.

      <h2>Why this exists (and who’s behind it).</h2>
      <p>
        The Angeles Crest 100 is one of the most iconic and confusing races in
        ultrarunning. The course is wild. The logistics are messy. The best
        advice is scattered across old PDFs, race reports, and half-remembered
        Facebook threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in the San Gabriel Valley, train on these trails, and I’m
        currently working toward my own first 50-mile finish on the way to
        AC100. This site is my way of turning local miles, maps, and mistakes
        into something you can actually use: clear guides, simple checklists,
        and honest notes from the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing here is official race guidance. It’s the unofficial playbook I
        wish I had when I first started looking at the Crest — shared so you
        can spend less time hunting for information and more time training.
