      <h1>AC100 Solo Division Playbook</h1>
      <p class="page__lede">
        No crew. No pacers. Just you, your drop bags, and the clock. This
        playbook is a working blueprint for finishing the Angeles Crest 100
        Solo division without guessing your way through race day.
      </p>
      <p class="page__lede">
        This is not official race guidance. Always confirm current rules with
        the AC100 race organization, then use this as a practical overlay from
        a San Gabriel local.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>1. What “Solo” really means at AC100</h2>
      <p>Short explanation of Solo rules, benefits (lottery, buckle), and constraints.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No on-course crew support or pacers.</li>
        <li>Drop bags and aid stations become your entire support system.</li>
        <li>Mental and logistical prep is as important as physical training.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>2. Solo mindset: what you’re signing up for</h2>
      <p>Set expectations here.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Owning problems instead of outsourcing them to crew.</li>
        <li>Planning self-care routines ahead of time.</li>
        <li>Accepting long stretches with no one looking out for you.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>3. The Solo drop-bag matrix</h2>
      <p>
        Here you’ll eventually list every drop-bag location, typical mileage /
        time, and what a Solo runner should plan to have there.
      </p>
      <p>Skeleton structure:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aid station</th>
            <th>Mile</th>
            <th>Time window (example)</th>
            <th>Primary goals</th>
            <th>Key items in drop bag</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Example Aid</td>
            <td>XX</td>
            <td>HH:MM–HH:MM</td>
            <td>Refill, re-lube, swap bottles</td>
            <td>Spare socks, small lube, calories, etc.</td>
          </tr>
          <!-- Fill in real stations later -->
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>4. Solo pacing & decision rules</h2>
      <p>Give simple guardrails instead of complex spreadsheets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early high-country pace limits (don’t burn your quads).</li>
        <li>“If X happens by mile Y, then do Z” rules (walk breaks, nutrition resets).</li>
        <li>When to sit (almost never) and when to keep moving no matter what.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>5. Hydration, calories, and heat when you have no crew</h2>
      <p>Outline Solo-specific systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Baseline plan for calories per hour and fluid per hour.</li>
        <li>How to pre-pack “emergency backup” calories in each bag.</li>
        <li>Heat management without someone handing you ice or cold bottles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This section is a natural place to link to affiliate gear:
        handheld bottles, hydration vests, soft flasks, cooling gear, etc.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>6. Self-care scripts at each major bag</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of vague “take care of your feet”, define scripts you repeat at
        specific stations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feet check protocol: socks, lube, hot spots, fresh tape.</li>
        <li>Body check: sunscreen, salt crust, chafing, light stretch.</li>
        <li>Mind check: “What’s actually wrong vs what’s just uncomfortable?”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>7. Night strategy when you’re solo</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary and backup light setup, plus batteries.</li>
        <li>How often to eat and drink when you’re tired and cold.</li>
        <li>Micro-goals to keep moving through the dark (next turn, next song, next climb).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>8. Mental tools for low points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“Name it, don’t be it” method for problems (feet, stomach, energy, mood).</li>
        <li>Pre-written reasons to keep going and when you would legitimately stop.</li>
        <li>Simple breathing or counting drills to calm panic.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>9. Solo training missions</h2>
      <p>
        Link this to your training missions / app idea: specific runs designed
        to rehearse Solo situations (no headphones, no crew, night starts,
        back-to-back long days).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“No backup” long run with full self-supported aid setup.</li>
        <li>Night-only run after a full workday.</li>
        <li>Back-to-back days on tired legs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="page__section">
      <h2>10. Solo checklist</h2>
      <p>End with a tight pre-race checklist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rules reviewed and trail work / qualifier confirmed.</li>
        <li>All drop-bag contents packed and labeled.</li>
        <li>Gear tested at least once at night and once in heat.</li>
        <li>Personal “why” written down and stored in one drop bag.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eventually you can offer this as a printable PDF Solo packet in
        exchange for email or as a low-cost product.

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>
        This Solo Playbook is a working draft. I’ll be filling in real aid
        stations, splits, and examples based on the current year’s race
        details and local recon.
